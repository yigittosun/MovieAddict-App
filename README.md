# MovieAddict-App

## Description of Project

The movies were recorded via [moviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).I was asked to make a web application where the movies are listed and we can see the details of these movies.

I built the project using Nuxt.js as you mentioned.In the moviedb documentation you sent me, I got help from the articles showing how to call the APIs. 
While writing CSS, I preferred to write in SASS format. I used the Bootstrap library.

When you run the project for the first time, you see header, content and footer sections.

In the ***Header Section***, 

There is the movie logo on the left, and the ***Popular***, ***On the cinema*** and ***About*** section on the right.

In the ***Content Section***, 

I show the movies that are shown with the slider. As you go down, there is a bar where we can search for the movie we want in the search bar. Then there are the movies that I show popular movies.
We also have the chance to look at other pages with pagination.When you hover over the films, you can see all the information you want from me. Also, to go to the detail page about the film, 
simply click on the name or poster of the film.

In the ***Footer Section***

I wanted simplicity in the footer section and just added my website extension name.

### Details Page

In this section, you can see the movie features you want and the details about the movie.

### About Page

In order not to be empty in this section, I added a button where we can go to the movies on the main page. And I filled it with loremipsum.

### Popular Page

Here we can see the films that have remained popular until today.

### On The  Cinema

In this section, we can see the movies that are currently shown in cinemas.


### For installation, 

You can run the project by typing ***npm install*** followed by ***npm start dev***.
